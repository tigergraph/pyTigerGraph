"""Factory Functions
Factory Functions are a special collection of functions that return an instance of a class.

All factory functions are methods of the `GDS` class. 
You can call a factory function after instantiating a TigerGraph Connection. 
For example:

[,python]
----
conn = TigerGraphConnection(
    host="http://127.0.0.1", 
    graphname="Cora",
    username="tigergraph",
    password="tigergraph",
)
edge_loader = conn.gds.edgeLoader(
    num_batches=1,
    attributes=["time", "is_train"])
----

The object returned has access to instance methods of the class. 
You can find the reference for those classes on the following pages:

        """Returns a `NeighborLoader` instance.
        A `NeighborLoader` instance performs neighbor sampling from vertices in the graph in batches in the following manner:

        . It chooses a specified number (`batch_size`) of vertices as seeds. 
        The number of batches is the total number of vertices divided by the batch size. 
        * If you specify the number of batches (`num_batches`) instead, `batch_size` is calculated by dividing the total number of vertices by the number of batches.
        If specify both parameters, `batch_size` takes priority. 
        . It picks a specified number (`num_neighbors`) of neighbors of each seed at random.
        . It picks the same number of neighbors for each neighbor, and repeats this process until it finished performing a specified number of hops (`num_hops`).
        
        This generates one subgraph. 
        As you loop through this data loader, every vertex will at some point be chosen as a seed and you will get the subgraph
        expanded from the seeds. 
        If you want to limit seeds to certain vertices, the boolean
        attribute provided to `filter_by` will be used to indicate which vertices can be
        included as seeds.
        If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges, 
        use the `dict` input for `v_in_feats`, `v_out_labels`, `v_extra_feats`,
        `e_in_feats`, `e_out_labels`, `e_extra_feats` where keys of the dict are vertex 
        or edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the
        vertex or edge types. 

        NOTE: When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time,
        the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding
        query to the database. However, the query installation only
        needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader
        on the same graph again.

        """Returns an `EdgeLoader` instance. 
        An `EdgeLoader` instance loads all edges in the graph in batches.

        It divides all edges into `num_batches` and returns each batch separately.
        You can also specify the size of each batch, and the number of batches is calculated accordingly. 
        If you provide both parameters, `batch_size` take priority. 
        The boolean attribute provided to `filter_by` indicates which edges are included.
        If you want to load from certain types of edges, 
        use the `dict` input for `attributes` where keys of the dict are edge types to be 
        selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the edge types. 
        If you need random batches, set `shuffle` to True.

        NOTE: When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time,
        the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding
        query to the database. However, the query installation only
        needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader
        on the same graph again.

        There are two ways to use the data loader.

        * It can be used as an iterable, which means you can loop through
          it to get every batch of data. If you load all edges at once (`num_batches=1`),
          there will be only one batch (of all the edges) in the iterator.
        * You can access the `data` property of the class directly. If there is
          only one batch of data to load, it will give you the batch directly instead
          of an iterator. If there are
          multiple batches of data to load, it returns the loader itself.

        Args:
            attributes (list or dict, optional):
                Edge attributes to be included. If it is a list, then the attributes
                in the list from all edge types will be selected. An error will be thrown if
                certain attribute doesn't exist in all edge types. If it is a dict, keys of the 
                dict are edge types to be selected, and values are lists of attributes to be 
                selected for each edge type. Numeric, boolean and string attributes are allowed.

            batch_size (int, optional):
                Number of edges in each batch.
                Defaults to None.
            num_batches (int, optional):
                Number of batches to split the edges.
                Defaults to 1.
            shuffle (bool, optional):
                Whether to shuffle the edges before loading data.
                Defaults to False.
            filter_by (str, dict, list, optional):
                Denotes the name of a boolean attribute used to indicate which vertices
                can be included as seeds. If a dictionary is provided, must be in the form of: 
                {"vertex_type": "attribute"}. If a list, must contain multiple filters and an 
                unique loader will be returned for each list element. Defaults to None.
            output_format (str, optional):
                Format of the output data of the loader. Only
                "dataframe" is supported. Defaults to "dataframe".
            loader_id (str, optional):
                An identifier of the loader which can be any string. It is
                also used as the Kafka topic name if Kafka topic is not given. If `None`, a random string will be generated
                for it. Defaults to None.
            buffer_size (int, optional):
                Number of data batches to prefetch and store in memory. Defaults to 4.
            reverse_edge (bool, optional):
                Whether to traverse along reverse edge types. Defaults to False.
            delimiter (str, optional):
                What character (or combination of characters) to use to separate attributes as batches are being created.

            timeout (int, optional):

                A callable function to apply to each batch in the dataloader. Defaults to None.

        """Returns a `GraphLoader`instance.
        A `GraphLoader` instance loads all edges from the graph in batches, along with the vertices that are connected with each edge.

        Different from NeighborLoader which produces connected subgraphs, this loader
        generates (random) batches of edges and vertices attached to those edges.

        If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges, 
        use the `dict` input for `v_in_feats`, `v_out_labels`, `v_extra_feats`,
        `e_in_feats`, `e_out_labels`, `e_extra_feats` where keys of the dict are vertex 
        or edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the
        vertex or edge types. 

        NOTE: When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time,
        the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding
        query to the database. However, the query installation only
        needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader
        on the same graph again.

        There are two ways to use the data loader:

        * It can be used as an iterable, which means you can loop through
          it to get every batch of data. If you load all data at once (`num_batches=1`),
          there will be only one batch (of all the data) in the iterator.
        * You can access the `data` property of the class directly. If there is
          only one batch of data to load, it will give you the batch directly instead
          of an iterator, which might make more sense in that case. If there are
          multiple batches of data to load, it will return the loader itself.

        An `EdgeNeighborLoader` instance performs neighbor sampling from all edges in the graph in batches in the following manner:

        . It chooses a specified number (`batch_size`) of edges as seeds. 
        The number of batches is the total number of edges divided by the batch size. 
        * If you specify the number of batches (`num_batches`) instead, `batch_size` is calculated by dividing the total number of vertices by the number of batches.
        If specify both parameters, `batch_size` takes priority. 
        . Starting from the vertices attached to the seed edges, it picks a specified number (`num_neighbors`) of neighbors of each vertex at random.
        . It picks the same number of neighbors for each neighbor, and repeats this process until it finished performing a specified number of hops (`num_hops`).
        
        This generates one subgraph. 
        As you loop through this data loader, every edge will at some point be chosen as a seed and you will get the subgraph
        expanded from the seeds. 
        If you want to limit seeds to certain edges, the boolean
        attribute provided to `filter_by` will be used to indicate which edges can be
        included as seeds.
        If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges,

        """Returns a `NodePieceLoader` instance.
        A `NodePieceLoader` instance loads all edges from the graph in batches, along with the vertices that are connected with each edge.

        The NodePiece algorithm borrows the idea of "tokenization" from Natural Language Processing. The dataloader offers the functionality
        to "tokenize" the graph in the form of randomly selecting "anchor vertices". If you are running NodePiece for the first time,
        anchors have to be created.

        NOTE: The first time you initialize the loader on a graph, it must first install the corresponding query to the database. 
        However, the query installation only needs to be done once, so you will not need to wait when you initialize the loader on the same graph again.

        There are two ways to use the data loader:

        * It can be used as an iterable, which means you can loop through
          it to get every batch of data. If you load all data at once (`num_batches=1`),
          there will be only one batch (of all the data) in the iterator.
        * You can access the `data` property of the class directly. If there is
          only one batch of data to load, it will give you the batch directly instead
          of an iterator, which might make more sense in that case. If there are
          multiple batches of data to load, it will return the loader itself.

        Args:
            v_feats (list or dict, optional):
                If a heterogenous graph, dictionary of the form {"VERTEX_TYPE": ["vertex_attribute1", ...]}.
                If a homogeneous graph, list of the form ["vertex_attribute1", ...].
                If None, all vertex types will be used, but no vertex attributes will be loaded. 
                If not None, only vertex types specified will be used.
            target_vertex_types (str or list, optional):
                A list or string of vertex types that are going to be used for training the model.
                If None, the vertex types specified in v_feats will be used.
            compute_anchors (bool, optional):
                False by default. If set to True, the dataloader will compute anchors and store them in the attribute
                defined by `anchor_attribute`. 
            use_cache (bool, optional):
                False by default. If True, will cache the result of the anchor search process onto the attribute
                defined by `anchor_cache_attr`. Must define `anchor_cache_attr` if True.
            clear_cache (bool, optional):
                False by default. If True, the cache of the anchor search process will be cleared for the attribute
                defined by `anchor_cache_attr`.
            anchor_method (str, optional):
                "random" by default. Currently, "random" anchor selection strategy is the only strategy supported.
            anchor_cache_attr (str, optional):
                Defines the attribute name to store the cached anchor search results in. By default, the attribute is "anchors".
            max_distance (int, optional):
                The max number of hops away in the graph to search for anchors. Defaults to 5.
            max_anchors (int, optional):
                The max number of anchors used to generate representation of target vertex. Defaults to 10.
            max_relational_context (int, optional):
                The max number of edge types to collect to generate representation of target vertex. Defaults to 10.
            anchor_percentage (float, optional):
                The percentage of vertices to use as anchors. Defaults to 0.01 (1%).
            anchor_attribute (str, optional):
                Attribute to store if a vertex is an anchor. Defaults to "is_anchor".
            e_types (list, optional):
                List of edge types to use in traversing the graph. Defaults to all edge types.
            global_schema_change (bool, optional):
                By default False. Must be True if altering the schema of global namespace graphs.
            tokenMap (dict or str, optional):
                Optional, for use when wanting to transfer the token -> index map from one NodePiece dataloader instance to another.
                Takes in a dictonary of token -> index, or a filepath to a pickle file containing the map. This map can be produced using the
                `saveTokens()` method of the NodePiece loader.
            batch_size (int, optional):
                The batch size to iterate through. Defaults to None.
            num_batches (int, optional):
                The number of batches to produce. Defaults to 1.
            shuffle (bool, optional):
                Whether to shuffle the vertices before loading data.
                Defaults to False.
            filter_by (str, dict, list, optional):
                Denotes the name of a boolean attribute used to indicate which vertices
                can be included as seeds. If a dictionary is provided, must be in the form of: 
                {"vertex_type": "attribute"}. If a list, must contain multiple filters and an 
                unique loader will be returned for each list element. Defaults to None.
            loader_id (str, optional):
                An identifier of the loader which can be any string. It is
                also used as the Kafka topic name if Kafka topic is not given. If `None`, a random string will be generated
                for it. Defaults to None.
            buffer_size (int, optional):
                Number of data batches to prefetch and store in memory. Defaults to 4.
            reverse_edge (bool, optional):
                Whether to traverse along reverse edge types. Defaults to False.
            delimiter (str, optional):
                What character (or combination of characters) to use to separate attributes as batches are being created.
                Defaults to "|".
            timeout (int, optional):
                Timeout value for GSQL queries, in ms. Defaults to 300000.
            callback_fn (callable, optional):
                A callable function to apply to each batch in the dataloader. Defaults to None.
            reinstall_query (bool, optional):
                Whether to reinstall the queries associated with this loader at instantiation. One can also call the member function
                `reinstall_query()` on a loader instance to reinstall the queries at any time. 
                Defaults to False.
            distributed_query (bool, optional):
                Whether to install the query in distributed mode. Defaults to False.

        """Returns a `HGTLoader` instance.
        A `HGTLoader` instance performs stratified neighbor sampling from vertices in the graph in batches in the following manner:

        . It chooses a specified number (`batch_size`) of vertices as seeds. 
        The number of batches is the total number of vertices divided by the batch size. 
        * If you specify the number of batches (`num_batches`) instead, `batch_size` is calculated by dividing the total number of vertices by the number of batches.
        If specify both parameters, `batch_size` takes priority. 
        . It picks a specified number of neighbors of each type (as specified by the dict `num_neighbors`) of each seed at random.
        . It picks the specified number of neighbors of every type for each neighbor, and repeats this process until it finished performing a specified number of hops (`num_hops`).
        
        This generates one subgraph. 
        As you loop through this data loader, every vertex will at some point be chosen as a seed and you will get the subgraph
        expanded from the seeds. 
        If you want to limit seeds to certain vertices, the boolean
        attribute provided to `filter_by` will be used to indicate which vertices can be
        included as seeds.
        If you want to load from certain types of vertices and edges, 
        use the `dict` input for `v_in_feats`, `v_out_labels`, `v_extra_feats`,
        `e_in_feats`, `e_out_labels`, `e_extra_feats` where keys of the dict are vertex 
        or edge types to be selected and values are lists of attributes to collect from the
        vertex or edge types. 

        NOTE: When you initialize the loader on a graph for the first time,
        the initialization might take a minute as it installs the corresponding
        query to the database. However, the query installation only
        needs to be done once, so it will take no time when you initialize the loader
        on the same graph again.

        Args:
            num_neighbors (dict):
                Number of neighbors of each type to sample. Keys are vertex types and values
